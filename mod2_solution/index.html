                This page is really open-source, as I have made it open source. Please check my GitHub repo for further
                information. This also implies that it can be bulit as per your choice, and you can save its copy
                anytime through GitHub.

                What's more interesting is that the GitHub takes it as its responsibility to make the page always up and
                running, meaning that you can come back here in the same URL anytime later. Also, if you have any
                changes to suggest, feel free to open any Pull Request or issue in the Repo. Check it out for more info.
